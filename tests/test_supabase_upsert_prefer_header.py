"""Regression test for v0.15.1: Supabase upsert Prefer header overwrite.

In v0.15.0 the SupabaseBackend client was initialised with a global
`Prefer: return=representation` header. postgrest-py's per-call upsert
builds its own Prefer header that includes `resolution=merge-duplicates`,
but the global header silently overwrites the per-call one during
`SyncRequestBuilder.upsert`'s `headers.update(self.headers)` step.

Result: every Supabase upsert was sent as a plain INSERT, which failed
with `duplicate key value violates unique constraint memories_pkey` on
the second call. The bug shipped to PyPI as 0.15.0 and was caught
during the live OKF round-trip demo. Fix: drop the global Prefer
header; let each operation builder set its own.

This test pins the fix by asserting the global header is absent. A
future change that re-adds it MUST also handle the merge-vs-overwrite
semantics.
